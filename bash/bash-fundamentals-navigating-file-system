Basic Shell Commands for Navigating the Filesystem 👩‍💻🧭

A computer’s filesystem organizes files and directories in a tree-like structure, starting from the root directory 🌳

🔑Below are some key shell commands to navigate and manage this system:

1. pwd — Print Working Directory
Displays the full path of your current location in the filesystem.


$ pwd
/Users/sonny/Downloads


2. mkdir — Make Directory
Creates a new directory. If a path is provided, the new directory will be created there; otherwise, it will be made in the current directory.

$ mkdir new-directory
$ ls
old-directory new-directory


3. ls — List
Lists the contents of a directory. By default, it shows the contents of the current directory, but you can also specify another directory.

bash
Copy code
$ ls Desktop

4. cd — Change Directory
Moves you to a different directory. You can specify a full path, a subdirectory, or .. to go up one level.
$ cd some-directory
$ cd ..


5. touch — Create File
Creates a new, empty file in the current directory.
$ touch grocery-list.txt
